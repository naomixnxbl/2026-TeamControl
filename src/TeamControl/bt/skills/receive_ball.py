"""receive_ball skill — position a robot to intercept the incoming ball.

R009: Pure stateless skill function.  No py_trees imports, no class state,
no blackboard access.  Same inputs always produce the same output.

v1 behaviour: stationary receive — the robot holds position (zero velocity)
and waits for the ball to arrive.  The behaviour tree is responsible for
positioning the robot before this skill is invoked.
