# TurtleRabbitBT (v2 BT) — Integration into 2026 TeamControl

This document records the merge of the standalone **TurtleRabbitBT** repo
(`vscode-workspace/TurtleRabbitBT`) into the 2026 TeamControl repo so the
new behaviour tree can be exercised against grSim using the existing
network / world-model stack.

It is intentionally lightweight: it documents what moved, where, and how
to run a tick loop. Deeper design notes for the BT itself live in
[bt_contracts.md](bt_contracts.md) (copied verbatim from the source repo).

## What was moved

| Source (TurtleRabbitBT)                | Destination (this repo)                          |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `src/bt/contracts/*`                   | `src/TeamControl/bt/contracts/*`                 |
| `src/bt/skills/*`                      | `src/TeamControl/bt/skills/*`                    |
| `src/bt/trees/*`                       | `src/TeamControl/bt/trees/*`                     |
| `src/bt/coordinator.py`                | `src/TeamControl/bt/coordinator.py`              |
| `tests/test_*.py`                      | `tests/bt/test_*.py`                             |
| `docs/contracts.md`                    | `docs/bt_contracts.md`                           |

All `src.bt.*` imports in the moved files were rewritten to
`TeamControl.bt.*`. Nothing else in the source files was edited; the BT
itself stays as it was authored.

## New files added in this repo

Two integration-only modules, plus this doc:

| File                                           | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/TeamControl/bt/adapter.py`               | Translates `WorldModel ⇄ Snapshot` and `Intent → RobotCommand`.         |
| `src/TeamControl/bt/run_bt_v2_process.py`     | Multiprocess entry point — mirrors `behaviour_tree/run_bt_process.py`.  |

The legacy `behaviour_tree/` package (`MainTree`, `cmd_mgr`, etc.) is left
untouched so existing harnesses still work while the v2 BT is exercised
side-by-side.

### Field mapping (`adapter.py`)

| `Snapshot` field        | Source in `WorldModel`                                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ball_position`         | `frame.ball.x`, `frame.ball.y`                                 |
| `ball_velocity`         | `(0, 0)` — **TODO** wire `velocity_est`                        |
| `own_robots`            | `frame.robots_yellow` or `_blue` depending on `wm.us_yellow()` |
| `opponent_robots`       | the other team                                                 |
| `referee_state.phase`   | `wm.get_game_state()` mapped via `_PHASE_MAP`                  |
| `referee_state.score`   | `(0, 0)` — **TODO** read from `wm.ref_data` once exposed       |

### Intent → MotionTarget → RobotCommand

| Intent          | Skill function used     | `kick` | `dribble` |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------|-----------|
| `IntentMove`    | `move_to`               | 0      | 0         |
| `IntentKick`    | `kick_at`               | 1      | 0         |
| `IntentPass`    | `kick_at` (target_pos)  | 1      | 0         |
| `IntentDribble` | `move_to` (placeholder) | 0      | 1         |
| `IntentOrient`  | zero-velocity, set `w`  | 0      | 0         |
| `IntentReceive` | zero-velocity           | 0      | 0         |

Angular velocity is a proportional wrap-around-pi controller in
`_angular_velocity_to_target`; the dispatcher / motion layer is expected
to consume `RobotCommand.w` directly.

## How to run against grSim

The current `src/TeamControl/SSL/grSim/sandbox.py` still wires the legacy
`run_bt_process` from `behaviour_tree/`. To exercise the v2 BT, edit
`sandbox.py` to swap that line for the new runner:

```python
# replace:
#   from behaviour_tree.run_bt_process import run_bt_process
#   bt = Process(target=run_bt_process, args=(wm, dispatcher_q,))
# with:
from TeamControl.bt.run_bt_v2_process import run_bt_v2_process
bt = Process(target=run_bt_v2_process, args=(is_running, wm, dispatcher_q,))
```

Then run as usual:

```powershell
.\run.bat              # or:  python -m TeamControl.SSL.grSim.sandbox
```

The runner builds one tree per role (Goalie / Defender / Supporter /
Attacker) and ticks robots `0..5`. Role assignment is fixed in
`Coordinator.ROLE_ASSIGNMENT` (`0=GOALIE, 1-2=DEFENDER, 3-4=SUPPORTER,
5=ATTACKER`).

The loop sleeps `TICK_PERIOD = 0.01 s` (100 Hz target). If `WorldModel`
has not received its first vision frame yet, the tick is skipped.

---

## Field side convention (`us_positive`)

Every tree that cares about field direction (`GoalieTree`, `AttackerTree`,
`DefenderTree`, `SupporterTree`) receives a single `us_positive: bool`
argument at construction time.

```
us_positive = True   →   OUR team occupies the +x half of the field
                         Our goal is at  x ≈ +4.5 m  (goalie defends +x end)
                         Opponent goal is at  x ≈ −4.5 m  (attacker shoots −x)

us_positive = False  →   OUR team occupies the −x half of the field
                         Our goal is at  x ≈ −4.5 m  (goalie defends −x end)
                         Opponent goal is at  x ≈ +4.5 m  (attacker shoots +x)
```

This value is read from `ipconfig.yaml` (`us_positive: true/false`) and
**must not be hardcoded** to a team colour. Yellow and blue can each occupy
either half depending on the match setup.

### How `us_positive` is derived in `run_bt_v2_process`

```python
cfg_us_positive = bool(_cfg.us_positive)   # our team's side from yaml
cfg_us_yellow   = bool(_cfg.us_yellow)     # which colour is "us" in yaml

# Same team as configured → use yaml value directly.
# Opponent team → flip it (they're on the other half).
_us_positive = cfg_us_positive if (is_yellow == cfg_us_yellow) else not cfg_us_positive
```

**Common mistake:** using `_us_positive = not is_yellow` (i.e. always
putting yellow on −x and blue on +x). This only works in one specific
field setup and will cause the goalie to defend the wrong goal and the
attacker to shoot into its own goal when the team is on the +x side.

## Running the moved tests

```powershell
pytest tests/bt -v
```

The original TurtleRabbitBT test suite is preserved as-is; only the
imports were rewritten. They do not require the rest of the TeamControl
stack to run — `py_trees` is the only non-stdlib dep.

---

## Known gaps / follow-ups

1. **Ball velocity** is hard-coded to `(0, 0)`. Wire `velocity_est` or
   compute from frame history so `IsBallComing` and pass logic can use
   real motion data.
2. **Referee score** is hard-coded `(0, 0)`; expose from `wm.ref_data`.
3. **Dribble** is mapped to `move_to`; build a real dribble skill that
   keeps the ball glued to the kicker.
4. **`IntentReceive`** holds station — should reposition to the predicted
   reception point once the pass play is wired.
5. **Angular controller** in the adapter is a simple P-controller. If the
   motion layer expects a target heading rather than `w`, push the
   conversion downstream and stop setting `w` here.
6. **Snapshot per-tick allocation**: each tick currently builds a fresh
   `Snapshot` (frozen dataclass + tuple coercions). If this shows up in
   profiling, batch the conversion or expose `WorldModel` accessors that
   yield the underlying objects in-place.
